This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You'll need to get your own API key from from [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and add it to a .env file in your project's root directory.
Don't forget React needs env variable to start with React__APP__
